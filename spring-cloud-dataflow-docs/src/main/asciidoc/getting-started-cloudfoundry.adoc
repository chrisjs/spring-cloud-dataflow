== Getting Started - Cloud Foundry

This section covers how to get started with Spring Cloud Data Flow on Cloud Foundry. Please see the https://dataflow.spring.io/documentation/{microsite-version}/installation/cloudfoundry/[Cloud Foundry] section of the microsite for more information on installing Spring Cloud Data Flow on Cloud Foundry.

Once you have the Data Flow server installed on Cloud Foundry, you will want to get started deploying pre-built microservices that Data Flow orchestrates. Below we have guides on how to get started with both link:https://dataflow.spring.io/documentation/{microsite-version}/stream-developer-guides/[Stream] and link:https://dataflow.spring.io/documentation/{microsite-version}/batch-developer-guides/[Batch] processing.
